# Cursor AI Preferences for this Project

## Commit Message Format

All Git commit messages must follow the [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Where:

- **type**: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, etc.)
- **scope**: Optional - the area of the codebase affected (e.g., ui, core, handlers)
- **subject**: Short description in imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **body**: Optional - detailed explanation of the change
- **footer**: Optional - references to issues, breaking changes, etc.

Example:

```text
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle

Implement dark mode support with toggle in settings panel.
Uses system preferences as default.

Closes #123
```

## Commit Behavior

- **DO NOT** automatically commit changes
- Always let the user review changes first before committing
- Only commit when explicitly requested by the user
- When committing, use the Conventional Changelog format described above
- **ALWAYS** run gofmt whenever making changes to a Go file
- **ALWAYS** check golangci-lint before committing a change and confirm there are no lint errors
