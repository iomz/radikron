# Cursor AI Preferences for this Project

## Commit Message Format

All Git commit messages must follow the [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Where:

- **type**: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, etc.)
- **scope**: Optional - the area of the codebase affected (e.g., ui, core, handlers)
- **subject**: Short description in imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **body**: Optional - detailed explanation of the change
- **footer**: Optional - references to issues, breaking changes, etc.

Example:

```text
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle

Implement dark mode support with toggle in settings panel.
Uses system preferences as default.

Closes #123
```

## Commit Behavior

- **NEVER commit changes without explicit user request**
- **DO NOT** automatically commit changes, even after making fixes or completing tasks
- **DO NOT** commit changes as part of completing a task unless the user explicitly asks you to commit
- Always let the user review changes first before committing
- Only commit when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "commit the changes", "commit this", etc.)
- When committing, use the Conventional Changelog format described above
- **ALWAYS** run gofmt whenever making changes to a Go file
- **ALWAYS** check golangci-lint before committing a change and confirm there are no lint errors. If golangci-lint reports issues, fix them before committing. If a fix is not possible immediately (e.g., requires architectural changes or external dependencies), document the issue in the commit message or open a GitHub issue, and get reviewer approval before committing with lint errors.

## Package Management

- **ALWAYS** use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for Node.js package management
- Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run dev`, etc.
- Never use `npm` commands in this project

## Building and Development

- When making changes to Go code, **ALWAYS** rebuild the binary to pick up changes
- For the CLI binary: `go build -o radikron ./cmd/radikron`
- For the GUI binary: `cd cmd/radikron-gui && wails build`
- When using `wails dev` for development, it should auto-rebuild, but pre-built binaries need manual rebuild
- The imports `github.com/iomz/radikron` reference local source files (correct for Go modules), but the binary must be rebuilt after code changes
